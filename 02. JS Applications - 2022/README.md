# [JavaScript Applications](https://softuni.bg/trainings/4228/js-applications-october-2023)

In the JS Applications course, students will learn what HTTP requests are and how to use them. They will learn about REST Services, what a Baas (backend as a service) is and how to work with it, what asynchronous code means (Promises, use of async/await), what Templating and Routing are. During the course, they will create a Single Page Application, using the techniques learned from previous lectures, on which they will be assessed. They will understand what is the architecture of an application and how to properly structure their applications. By the end of the course, they will look at different design patterns and their practical guidelines, create their own web components using the Web Components standard, and build a Webback environment from scratch.
