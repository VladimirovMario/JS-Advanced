# For Every New Project:

    Open the Task Folder:
        Navigate to the folder for your current task using your file explorer.

    Start Visual Studio Code (VSC):
        Open Visual Studio Code by right-clicking on the folder and selecting "Open with Code."

    Initialize a New npm Project:
        Open the terminal in VSC and run the following command to set up your project with default configurations:

```bash
npm init -y
```

## Install Required Packages:

    Install the necessary packages for your project. For example, if you are working with web pages, install the "page" and "lit-html" packages:

```bash
npm install page lit-html
```

## Additional Steps for Projects with a Server:

    Locate the Server Folder:
        If your task requires a server, locate the folder containing the server files.

    Start the Server:
        In the terminal, navigate to the server folder and start the server using the following command:

```bash
node server
```

## Access Your Application:

    To view your application, open the index.html file using an extension like "Live Server" in Visual Studio Code. This extension will provide you with a live preview of your project.
